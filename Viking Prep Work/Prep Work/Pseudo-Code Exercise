// Pseudo-Code Exercise

Mmmm... Grilled Cheese

Just to get in the right frame of mind, we'll start with a classic pseudocoding exercise -- writing a recipe. In this case, break out the recipe for making grilled cheese into discrete steps. It may seem simple but it should be at least 20-30 steps and include things like setting things up and checking if it's done. We'll start you off:

PROGRAM GrilledCheeseSandwich

	Find 
			Bread
			Cheese
		in the kitchen

	IF burner is turned off
		turn burner on
	END

	Place skillet on burner
	Combine bread and cheese to form sandwich
	Place butter on skillet
	IF butter is melted
		Place sandwich in skillet
			WHILE sandwich cooks
				IF sandwich color is not brown
					Flip sandwich in skillet
				ELSE 
					Remove sandwich from skillet
	END

	Place sandwich on counter

	IF burner is turned on
		turn burner off
	END

Shopping for Ingredients

Let's go shopping! You've got a list in hand with a variable number of things that need to be procured from the grocery store. The store is laid out into 10 aisles but their signs have all been taken down for repairs so you're not sure which aisles contain which foods.

Write a program which will acquire and then check out with all your items. Start with very broad strokes and then get more specific until you're comfortable with the level of detail. This will probably require more than 50 steps.

A Logic Game

10 friends are sitting in a circle around a table and decide to play a new game. In it, they count up through the numbers from 1 to 100. The first person says "1", the second says "2" and so on... but with a few catches:

Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So person 6 will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will say "8".
Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person.
Your job is to pseudocode a program which will determine which player says the number 100. For this one, be as specific as possible to actually write out the logic of the procedure.
